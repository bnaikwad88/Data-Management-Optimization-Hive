# Optimizing Data Management with a Data Migration and Transformation Solution for HIVE Data Warehouses

## Objective :
To write a Python program that will download a zip file from a given URL, extract the JSON files from the zip, parse the data from the JSON files, store the data in HDFS, and view the data through HIVE. You will need to use the requests, zipfile, and json libraries to accomplish this. Specifically, you should use the requests library to download the zip file, the zipfile library to extract the JSON files and parse the data from them, and the json library to parse the data from the JSON files. Once you have parsed the data, you can use the hadoop command-line utility or the WebHDFS REST API to store the data in HDFS, and use the hive command-line interface or a HIVE client to connect to the HIVE server and query and view the data.

## Approach:
1. To complete the task you described, you can follow these steps: 
2. Use the requests library to download the zip file from the given URL.
3. Use the zipfile library to extract the JSON files from the zip.
4. Use the json library to parse the data from the JSON files.
5. Use the hadoop command-line utility or the WebHDFS REST API to store the data in HDFS.
6. Use the hive command-line interface or a HIVE client to connect to the HIVE server and query and view the data.


## Expected Results: 
To download and analyze data from a remote source, you can use Python libraries such as requests, zipfile, and json to download a zip file from a URL, extract and parse the data from the JSON files contained in the zip, store the data in HDFS, and view and query the data through HIVE. This process involves sending an HTTP request to download the zip file, using the zipfile library to extract the JSON files and parse the data, using the hadoop command-line utility or the WebHDFS REST API to store the data in HDFS, and using the HIVE command-line interface or a HIVE client to connect to the HIVE server and execute queries against the data.
